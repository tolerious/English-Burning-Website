## Transcript

Narrator
Hello! Welcome back to the offices of Tip Top Trading, where **Anna**'s interview for a sales job continues. When we last said goodbye, Tip Top boss **Paul** had asked **Anna**

why she wanted the job. First she said:

**Anna**

Errr... mmmmm...

Narrator
Since then, she's added:

**Anna**

Mmmm... errr...

Narrator
And as we join her again, **Anna**

is saying:

**Anna**

Well, errrr... I'm errr.

Narrator
Come on, **Anna**

! If you can't think of the word you need, find another way of saying it.

**Anna**

I am... Well, I really, really want this job and I am willing to work very hard if I get it.

**Paul**

So you’re very motivated, then?

**Anna**

Motivated! Yes, that’s it. I am really motivated.

**Paul**

Good! Why?

Narrator
Now over to you **Anna**

; structure your answer! Say, 'firstly', then give your first reason, 'secondly' and then a second reason. Then say, 'above all' and give a really, really good, enthusiastic final reason! Go for it: firstly!

**Anna**

Firstly!

**Paul**

Firstly...?

**Anna**

Firstly, this job is an ideal match for my skills and experience: I've spent several years working in sales and I get on with people easily. Well, I mean, apart from the ones I don't like, of course. Secondly, I know Tip Top Trading is one of the fastest-growing companies in London, and I want to be part of that.

**Paul**

That's absolutely right. Tip Top Trading is the fastest-growing company in the plastic fruit sector. But enough about the company; this is all about you, Annabel.

**Anna**

**Anna**

.

**Paul**

Sorry, **Anna**

. Where were we?

**Anna**

Well, I said that firstly, this job is an ideal match for my skills and experience, secondly, the company is growing fast... and… and… above all… the reason I want this job is…

**Paul**

Yes? (knock on the door) Denise! Is everything alright?

Denise
No **Paul**
, it’s not. Everything is not OK!

**Paul**

You look pale. Here, sit down, drink what's left of my tea.

Denise
Oh, thank you! Oh… what are those bits floating in it?

**Paul**

Oh they're just lumps of soggy biscuit. In fact, if I can just... get that bit out... with my finger... for you… Mmm, delicious! Now, tell me what happened.

Denise
Well, it's terrible...

Narrator
Oh dear! Just as **Anna**

was doing really well, it looks like her interview has come to a sudden end. What’s happened? Join us next time to find out. But before we go, here's a reminder of how **Anna** structured her response:

    Firstly, this job is an ideal match for my skills and experience
    Secondly, I know Tip Top Trading is one of the fastest-growing companiesin London and…
    above all… the reason I want this job is…

**Anna**

couldn’t remember the word ‘motivated’, so she just found another way of saying what she meant.

    I really, really want the job and I am willing to work very hard if I get it.

Nice work, **Anna**
! Let's hope you get the chance to finish your interview next week!
