强热带风暴“卡努”将于今晚（08/11）登陆辽宁省，中国东北三省严阵以待。记者孙思奇带来更多报道。

Tropical Storm Khanun weakened after making landfall on the Korean Peninsula yesterday, but the storm center is now back out over the water east of the Liaodong peninsula, and its outer rings are dumping rain into northeastern China.

热带风暴“卡努”昨天（08/10）在朝鲜半岛登陆后强度减弱，目前风暴中心正向辽东半岛以东海域转移，其外围环流给中国东北地区带来强降雨。

Parts of southern Heilongjiang have already been hit with very intense rainfall, leading to damaged roads and downed communications.

黑龙江南部部分地区已遭受强降雨，导致道路受损、通讯中断。

The mountainous area of Jilin near the border with the DPRK has been dealing with moderate to heavy rainfall for 2 days. The city of Shulan, which had just been battered with floods, relocated 23,000 people from 20 towns and villages.

靠近朝鲜边境的吉林山区连续2天出现中到强降雨。刚刚遭受洪水袭击的舒兰市从20个乡镇转移了2.3万人。

Multiple cities in Liaoning have been busy relocating people and resources, the local authorities have also stepped up waterway and power line inspections.

辽宁多个城市一直在进行人员和资源转移工作，当地政府还加强了水路和电力线路的检查。

“我们对涉及水库供电的19座66千伏变电站、23条10千伏线路及所属设备开展隐患缺陷排查治理。”

“We're running inspections on nineteen 66-thousand-volt transformers and 23 ten-thousand-volt power lines.”

And here in Shanghai, temperatures made it back up over the 35 degree mark to 36.2 in the early afternoon. The local weather office says Khanun is partly to blame.

下午早些时候，上海气温又回升到35度以上，达到36.2度。当地气象局称部分原因是受到了强热带风暴“卡努”的影响。

“这两天副热带高压边缘的影响，包括卡努台风外围的下沉气流，也使得我们这两天最高气温要达到36度左右，周日气温也是在35度。”

“We're under the influence of downward moving air on the outermost rings of Khanun. Hence, the highs for the weekend will still hover between 35 and 36 degrees.”

Forecasters expect showers for the beginning of next week, which will bring daytime highs down to the low side of the mid-30s, and then into the low 30s by next weekend.

天气预报员预计，下周初将有阵雨，白天最高气温将降至35度左右，下周末将降至30度左右。
